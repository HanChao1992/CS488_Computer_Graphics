Compilation:

While in A2/ directory, run the following command to compile the program:
	$ premake4 gmake
	$ make
	run the program by:
	$ ./A2

No change was made to the default premake4/make combination.
The program was compiled an run on lab machine gl30.

Manual:

The World Coordinates and Model Coordinates are assumed to be clipped.
The viewport mode functionality does not work properly, but I request code
credit for this part.
