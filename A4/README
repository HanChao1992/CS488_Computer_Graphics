Compilation:

While in A4/ directory, run the following command to compile the program:
	$ premake4 gmake
	$ make
Then while in A4/Assets
	run the program by:
	$ ../A4 hier.lua 
The produced image will be located in the Assets folder.

No change was made to the default premake4/make combination.
The program was compiled an run on lab machine gl06.

Manual:

The program will output progress percentage, starting time, finishing time, and duration in seconds.

All features were implemented.
3x3 supersampling was implemented as the extra feature.

A sample.lua is provided.
This sample.lua demostrates Sphere, Cube, hierarchical transformations, shadow, hidden surface, and Phong illumination, and supersampling.

For screenshot.png I rendered a 512x512 simple-cow.lua because simple cows are cute.

For Bounding Volume Acceleration:
Please go in to Mesh.cpp in the A4 directory to set two variables manually, and then recompile the program.
BV and BVS
Set BV to 1 and BVS to 0 if you only want acceleration.
Set BV to 0 and BVS to 1 if you also want to see the bounding box.
By Default, BV is 1 and BVS is 0.

With acceleration I was able to render macho-cow.lua in 11 minutes(654 seconds) on gl06.
Without acceleration the time was 1 hour 6 minutes (3943 seconds).
